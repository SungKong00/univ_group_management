## 1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope

**Core Goal:** To enable new users to discover attractive groups through the **[Explore]** and **[Recruitment]** tabs, join them, and experience systematic announcements and detailed permission management within their groups.

### MVP Feature List:

1.  **Group Discovery & Recruitment:**
    - **[Explore] Tab:** A space for users to browse all groups. Each group has a profile page showcasing its identity and activity archive. Searchable by tags.
    - **[Recruitment] Tab:** A feed showing only groups that are actively recruiting. Posts contain key information like recruitment period, qualifications, etc.

2.  **Group Navigation:**
    - A hierarchical navigator (University -> College -> Department) to understand the overall group structure.

3.  **Announcements & Communication:**
    - Ability to create and view text-based announcements within a group.
    - **Threaded comments** are supported for organized discussions on announcements.

4.  **Permission Management:**
    - A detailed permission system from the start.
    - Group leaders can create custom roles (e.g., 'Accounting Team') and assign specific permissions (e.g., create announcements, invite members) to each role.
    - Group leaders can appoint a **'Supervising Professor'** who shares the same authority.

5.  **Notifications:**
    - Minimal, interaction-based notifications are sent only when:
        - A user's join request is **approved or rejected**.
        - A **new join request** is submitted to a group led by the user.
        - A user's **role is changed**.

6.  **Admin Page:**
    - A minimal set of tools for group management:
        - Member management (approve/reject, kick).
        - Role management (create/edit/delete).
        - Edit group information.

7.  **User Profile:**
    - Basic functionality for users to manage their own profile:
        - Edit profile picture, nickname, bio.
        - View a list of their groups.
        - Logout and leave the service.

## 2. Post-MVP Roadmap

**Development Goal:** To sequentially expand features so that users acquired through the MVP can settle in successfully and handle all core group activities within the app.

### 2.1. Major Feature Roadmap (In Order of Priority)

1.  **üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personalized Home (My Activities):** A personalized To-Do list to reduce information fatigue and encourage daily visits by showing tasks needing attention (e.g., new announcements, RSVPs).
2.  **üìÖ Calendar:** A central hub to view all group schedules in a monthly/weekly format.
3.  **‚è∞ Schedule Coordination (Admin-led):** A 'Smart Scheduling Board' for admins to view participants' availability and set optimal event times.
4.  **üßë‚Äçüè´ Professor/Operator Dashboard:** Anonymized statistical data (attendance rates, activity frequency) to support administrative tasks and enhance the app's official credibility.
5.  **‚ú® Functional Posts (Super Posts):** Ability to create posts with embedded functions like polls and RSVPs.
6.  **‚úÖ QR Code Attendance:** A system to manage attendance for offline events registered in the calendar.
7.  **üí¨ Real-time Chat Channels:** Separate channels for casual, real-time conversations to prevent users from leaving for external messengers like KakaoTalk.
8.  **Later Stages:** Kanban boards, accounting, gamification (badges), file management, dark mode, etc.

### 2.2. Detailed Feature Enhancements

- **Group & Permissions:**
    - Change group deletion from immediate to a **30-day retention period**.
    - Change subgroup deletion policy to **re-parenting** instead of cascading deletion.
    - Add **private/public** settings for groups.
    - Allow **individual permission adjustments** for specific members, overriding their role.

    - **Bulk Actions** (e.g., change roles for multiple members at once).
    - Display additional info like **'Last Seen'** in the member list.

- **Recruitment & Promotion:**
    - Feature recruitment posts on the **main home screen**.
    - Allow **image attachments** in posts.
