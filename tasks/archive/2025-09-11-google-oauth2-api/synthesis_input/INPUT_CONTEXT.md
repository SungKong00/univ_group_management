---

## 1. Sign-up / Login

- **1.1. Feature Definition:** Users select their role (student or professor) upon signing up, authenticate easily via Google social login, and complete registration by providing additional information and verifying their school email. A manual approval process by an admin is required for professor roles.
- **1.2. Goal:** To allow users to sign up safely and conveniently within 2 minutes, following a clear process tailored to their role.
- **1.3. Scope:** Google social login, role selection, additional info input (name, nickname), school email verification, and admin approval for professors.
- **1.4. User Stories:**
    - (Student) "I want to sign up easily with my Google account and quickly verify my school email."
    - (Professor) "I want a simple sign-up process but need my role to be securely verified. I understand if some features are limited pending approval."
- **1.5. Requirements:**
    - Must use Google OAuth2.
    - Role selection (student/professor) is mandatory.
    - Name, nickname, department, student ID are mandatory.
    - Nicknames must be unique.
    - A 6-digit verification code (valid for 5 minutes) will be sent to the school email.
    - Professor role applications are granted a 'Pending Approval' status, and an alert is sent to the admin.
- **1.6. UX/UI Flow (Toss UI/UX Philosophy):**
    - **One Screen, One Goal:** Each step is a full-page view to maintain focus.
    - **Flow:**
        1.  **Screen 1: Role Selection:** User chooses between [Start as Student] or [Start as Professor].
        2.  **Authentication:** Proceed with Google Account authentication.
        3.  **Screen 2: Profile & School Verification:** A single, scrollable screen for entering name, nickname, department, student ID, and school email. The verification code input field appears on the same screen after requesting the code.
        4.  **Authorization:** Appropriate permissions are granted. For professors, a "Pending Approval" banner is shown throughout the app.
- **1.7. Edge Cases:**
    - **Interruption:** Progress is not saved if the user leaves the sign-up process.
    - **Duplicate Nickname:** An immediate error message "Nickname is already in use" is displayed.
    - **Verification Code Error:** Appropriate error messages for incorrect code or expiration.
    - **Professor Rejection:** The user is notified, and their role is automatically changed to 'Student'.

---

## 2. Group / Workspace Management

- **2.1. Overview:** Allows users to form communities (groups) and operate dedicated collaboration spaces (workspaces).
- **2.2. Roles & Permissions:**
    - **System Admin:** Can create top-level groups and intervene if a group leader is absent.
    - **Group Leader (Student Rep):** Approves/rejects subgroup creations and member joins, **appoints/removes supervising professors**, delegates leadership, and deletes the group.
    - **Supervising Professor (Faculty):** Appointed by the Group Leader, shares all permissions with the Group Leader but cannot manage other leaders/professors.
    - **Group Member:** Standard user within a group.
    - **General User:** Can search for groups and apply to join.
- **2.3. Key Features:**
    - **Group Creation:** Admins create top-level groups; users can apply to create subgroups.
    - **Group Leader Functions:**
        - **Appoint/Remove Professor:** Can designate a 'Professor' role member as a 'Supervising Professor'.
        - **Delegate Leadership:** Must delegate leadership to another member before leaving.
        - **Force Removal:** Can remove members from the group.
        - **Delete Group (UX Change):** Deletion is confirmed via a **Bottom Sheet** that summarizes the data to be deleted (e.g., N members, N posts). The final action requires clicking a red [Delete] button, removing the need to type a confirmation phrase.
- **2.4. Policies:**
    - **Absent Group Leader (Simplified MVP Policy):** If a leader is inactive, the system automatically assigns leadership to the member who joined earliest among the highest-grade students.
    - **Data Deletion:**
        - Deleting a group **permanently and immediately deletes all associated data**.
        - When a user leaves the service, their posts/comments are **anonymized to '(Deleted User)'** but not deleted.
        - In MVP, deleting a parent group **cascades and deletes all its subgroups**.

---

## 3. Permissions / Member Management

- **3.1. System Structure:** Permissions are managed via 'Roles'. A Group Leader creates custom roles, assigns permissions to them, and then assigns roles to members.
- **3.2. Fixed Roles:**
    - **'Group Leader' (Student) & 'Supervising Professor' (Faculty):** Top-level roles with all permissions. They are immutable and cannot remove each other.
    - **'General Member':** The default role for all new members.
- **3.3. MVP Custom Permissions:** Integrated permissions like [Recruitment Management], [Member Management], [Channel Management] can be combined freely into custom roles.
- **3.4. Member Management Screen:**
    - Displays profile info, role, join date.
    - **'Group Leader' (üëë) and 'Supervising Professor' (üéñÔ∏è) are visually distinguished with icons.**
    - Roles can be changed instantly via a dropdown menu.

---

## 4. Promotion / Recruitment

- **4.1. Structure:** A dedicated **'Recruitment' board** lists all active recruitment posts.
- **4.2. Required Post Information:** Title, body, recruitment period (start/end dates via a date picker), number of people (free text like "5", "00", "Always recruiting"), and tags (#dev, #design).
- **4.3. Features by Role:**
    - **Group Leader (Poster):** Can create, edit, delete, and manually close their own recruitment posts.
    - **General User (Applicant):** Can view all active posts (sorted by newest first), search by title or tag, and apply by navigating to the group's page and using the standard 'Join Group' function.
- **4.4. Policies:**
    - A group can only have **one active recruitment post at a time**.
    - An attempt to create a new post while one is active will be blocked with an explanatory message.
    - Posts are automatically set to 'Closed' and hidden from the list when their end date passes.

---

## 5. Posts / Comments

- **5.1. Basic Structure:** A real-time chat format (like Slack) where the newest messages appear at the bottom. The message composer is fixed at the bottom of the screen.
- **5.2. Post (Message) Details:** Consists of author info, timestamp, content, and comment count. CRUD is standard, with the 'Channel Management' role having permission to delete others' messages.
- **5.3. Comment Details & Policy:**
    - Comments are managed as **Threads** attached to a message.
    - **MVP Architecture:** Only **single-level comments (no replies-to-replies)** will be implemented.
    - **DB Design:** The `Comment` table will include a `parent_comment_id` field for future expansion, but it will be `null` in the MVP.
    - **Deletion Policy:** If a parent comment is deleted, **all its child comments (replies) are also permanently deleted.**

---

## 6. Notification System

- **6.1. Architecture:** Notification data is stored in a **structured format** (including source, target, type) to support future features like a personalized home feed.
- **6.2. Data Retention Policy:** Notifications are **automatically deleted after 90 days**.
- **6.3. UX/UI:**
    - A bell (üîî) icon in the header displays a **red badge** for unread notifications.
    - Clicking the icon opens a **dropdown list** of recent notifications.
    - Opening the dropdown automatically marks all visible notifications as **'read'**, and the badge disappears.
    - Clicking a notification navigates the user to the relevant page (e.g., the post where a comment was made).
- **6.4. MVP Notification Triggers:**
    - When my group join request is **approved or rejected**.
    - When a **new join request** is submitted to a group I lead.
    - When my **role is changed**.

---

## 7. Admin Page

- **7.1. Access & UI Concept:** A 'Management' button is visible only to users with at least one admin permission. The admin home uses **icon-based cards/lists** instead of plain text, providing context like a `Pending N` badge next to the `Member Management` menu. Only menus for which the user has permission are shown.
- **7.2. MVP Feature List:** Member Management, Role Management, Channel Management, Supervising Professor Management, Edit Group Info, Delete Group.
- **7.3. Key Flows (Toss UI/UX Philosophy):**
    - **Role & Channel Management:** Uses a **'single-screen settings'** approach. For example, creating a role shows the name input and all permission toggles on one page for immediate configuration and saving.
    - **Group Deletion:** Uses a **Bottom Sheet** to clearly display what will be deleted and requires a final click on a red [Delete] button for confirmation.

---

## 8. User Profile & Account Management

- **8.1. 'My Info' Screen:** Accessed via the 'My Page' icon. Contains menus for My Groups, Application Status, Login Info, Logout, and Leave Service.
- **8.2. Key Flows:**
    - **Profile Editing:** Modify profile picture, nickname, and bio.
    - **Leave Service (UX Change):**
        - Clicking 'Leave Service' brings up a **Bottom Sheet**.
        - The sheet explains the consequences (e.g., "Your posts will be anonymized").
        - Final confirmation requires clicking a red [Leave] button at the bottom. The "type to confirm" step is removed.
- **8.3. Policies:**
    - **Nickname:** Must be unique.
    - **Profile Visibility:** Public to everyone in the MVP.
    - **Account Deletion:** User-generated content (posts, comments) is **anonymized to '(Unknown)' or '(Deleted User)'** but not deleted.

# Project Plan: MVP and Post-MVP Roadmap

This document outlines the project's scope, starting with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and followed by the development roadmap. It is synthesized from `MVP.md` and `MVP Ïù¥ÌõÑ Í∞úÎ∞ú Î°úÎìúÎßµ.md`.

---

## 1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope

**Core Goal:** To enable new users to discover attractive groups through the **[Explore]** and **[Recruitment]** tabs, join them, and experience systematic announcements and detailed permission management within their groups.

### MVP Feature List:

1.  **Group Discovery & Recruitment:**
    - **[Explore] Tab:** A space for users to browse all groups. Each group has a profile page showcasing its identity and activity archive. Searchable by tags.
    - **[Recruitment] Tab:** A feed showing only groups that are actively recruiting. Posts contain key information like recruitment period, qualifications, etc.

2.  **Group Navigation:**
    - A hierarchical navigator (University -> College -> Department) to understand the overall group structure.

3.  **Announcements & Communication:**
    - Ability to create and view text-based announcements within a group.
    - **Threaded comments** are supported for organized discussions on announcements.

4.  **Permission Management:**
    - A detailed permission system from the start.
    - Group leaders can create custom roles (e.g., 'Accounting Team') and assign specific permissions (e.g., create announcements, invite members) to each role.
    - Group leaders can appoint a **'Supervising Professor'** who shares the same authority.

5.  **Notifications:**
    - Minimal, interaction-based notifications are sent only when:
        - A user's join request is **approved or rejected**.
        - A **new join request** is submitted to a group led by the user.
        - A user's **role is changed**.

6.  **Admin Page:**
    - A minimal set of tools for group management:
        - Member management (approve/reject, kick).
        - Role management (create/edit/delete).
        - Edit group information.

7.  **User Profile:**
    - Basic functionality for users to manage their own profile:
        - Edit profile picture, nickname, bio.
        - View a list of their groups.
        - Logout and leave the service.

## 2. Post-MVP Roadmap

**Development Goal:** To sequentially expand features so that users acquired through the MVP can settle in successfully and handle all core group activities within the app.

### 2.1. Major Feature Roadmap (In Order of Priority)

1.  **üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personalized Home (My Activities):** A personalized To-Do list to reduce information fatigue and encourage daily visits by showing tasks needing attention (e.g., new announcements, RSVPs).
2.  **üìÖ Calendar:** A central hub to view all group schedules in a monthly/weekly format.
3.  **‚è∞ Schedule Coordination (Admin-led):** A 'Smart Scheduling Board' for admins to view participants' availability and set optimal event times.
4.  **üßë‚Äçüè´ Professor/Operator Dashboard:** Anonymized statistical data (attendance rates, activity frequency) to support administrative tasks and enhance the app's official credibility.
5.  **‚ú® Functional Posts (Super Posts):** Ability to create posts with embedded functions like polls and RSVPs.
6.  **‚úÖ QR Code Attendance:** A system to manage attendance for offline events registered in the calendar.
7.  **üí¨ Real-time Chat Channels:** Separate channels for casual, real-time conversations to prevent users from leaving for external messengers like KakaoTalk.
8.  **Later Stages:** Kanban boards, accounting, gamification (badges), file management, dark mode, etc.

### 2.2. Detailed Feature Enhancements

- **Group & Permissions:**
    - Change group deletion from immediate to a **30-day retention period**.
    - Change subgroup deletion policy to **re-parenting** instead of cascading deletion.
    - Add **private/public** settings for groups.
    - Allow **individual permission adjustments** for specific members, overriding their role.

- **Member Management:**
    - **Bulk Actions** (e.g., change roles for multiple members at once).
    - Display additional info like **'Last Seen'** in the member list.

- **Recruitment & Promotion:**
    - Feature recruitment posts on the **main home screen**.
    - Allow **image attachments** in posts.

# System Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture, synthesized from the 9 documents in `docs/ÏÑ§Í≥Ñ Î¨∏ÏÑú/ÏïÑÌÇ§ÌÖçÏ≤ò ÏÑ§Í≥Ñ /`. It covers general deployment, backend (Spring Boot), frontend (Flutter), and detailed API specifications.

---

## 1. General Architecture & Deployment

- **Tech Stack**:
    - **Frontend**: Flutter (targeting Web as the primary platform).
    - **Backend**: Spring Boot with Kotlin.
    - **Database**: RDBMS (planned for AWS RDS).

- **Deployment Architecture (AWS)**:
    - A minimal setup using **EC2 (Server) + RDS (DB) + S3 (Build Storage)**.
    - **Unified Deployment**: The Flutter web build output (HTML, JS) is included in the Spring Boot project's `src/main/resources/static` directory. The entire application is deployed as a single JAR file, with Spring Boot handling both API serving and web hosting.

- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**:
    - **Trigger**: Merging code from the `develop` branch into the `main` branch triggers an automatic deployment to production.
    - **Pipeline**: 
        1. Build and test the project.
        2. Upload the executable JAR to AWS S3.
        3. Connect to AWS EC2, pull the new JAR from S3, and run the server.
    - **Secrets Management**: All sensitive information (DB passwords, JWT keys) is stored in GitHub Actions Secrets and used to dynamically generate `application-prod.yml` during the CI/CD process.

---

## 2. Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)

### 2.1. Code-Level 3-Layer Architecture

The backend follows a strict, single-direction data flow (`Controller` ‚Üí `Service` ‚Üí `Repository`).

- **`Controller`**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and performs first-pass syntactic validation on DTOs (`@Valid`). It knows nothing about Entities.
- **`Service`**: Contains all business logic, manages transactions (`@Transactional`), and is solely responsible for converting between DTOs and Entities. It performs second-pass semantic validation (business rules).
- **`Repository`**: Manages data persistence (CRUD) by communicating directly with the database. It knows nothing about DTOs.

### 2.2. API Design Principles

- **Standard Response Format**: All API responses are wrapped in a standard JSON envelope:
  ```json
  {
      "success": boolean,
      "data": { ... } | [ ... ] | null,
      "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } | null
  }
  ```
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Standard codes are used (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

### 2.3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication Flow**: 
    1. Frontend gets a **Google Auth Token** via Google Sign-In.
    2. This token is sent to the backend (`POST /api/auth/google`).
    3. Backend validates the token with Google, finds or creates a user in the DB.
    4. Backend generates and returns a service-specific **JWT Access Token**.
    5. Frontend sends this JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header for all subsequent requests.
- **Authorization Strategy**: 
    - **Method Security**: Authorization is handled declaratively at the method level using Spring Security's `@PreAuthorize` annotation.
    - **Custom Evaluator**: A custom permission evaluator (e.g., `@groupPermissionEvaluator`) is used within `@PreAuthorize` to check complex, domain-specific permissions (e.g., `hasPermission(#groupId, 'MEMBER_KICK')`).

### 2.4. Exception Handling & Logging

- **Global Exception Handling**: A central `@RestControllerAdvice` class catches all exceptions. Custom `BusinessException` (containing an `ErrorCode` enum) is used for predictable errors, which are translated into the standard error JSON format.
- **Logging Strategy (SLF4J + Logback)**:
    - **Levels**: `DEBUG` for local/dev, `INFO` for production.
    - **Content**: `INFO` for key events (server start), `WARN` for potential issues, `ERROR` for all exceptions (with stack trace for 500 errors).
    - **Rotation**: Logs are rotated daily and kept for a maximum of 30 days.

### 2.5. Testing Strategy

- **Pyramid Focus**: The strategy prioritizes **Integration Tests** over Unit Tests. E2E tests are out of scope for MVP.
- **Environment**: Tests run against an **H2 in-memory database** for speed and isolation.
- **Structure**: 
    - An `IntegrationTest` base class provides common setup (`@SpringBootTest`).
    - A `DatabaseCleanup` component ensures each test runs on a clean DB (`@AfterEach`).
    - An `AcceptanceTest` helper class abstracts away `MockMvc` complexity, allowing tests to be written in a business-readable format (e.g., `acceptanceTest.createGroup(...)`).

---

## 3. Frontend Architecture (Flutter)

- **State Management**: **Riverpod** is used for its compile-time safety, flexibility, and scalability.
- **Project Structure**: A **Layered Architecture** is used to separate concerns:
    - `lib/data/`: Models and Repositories (server communication).
    - `lib/providers/`: State management logic (Riverpod providers).
    - `lib/presentation/`: UI (Screens and Widgets).
    - `lib/core/`: Shared utilities (routing, constants).
- **API Client**: **dio** is used, primarily for its **Interceptor** feature, which allows for the automatic injection of the JWT `Authorization` header into all API requests.
- **Routing**: **go_router** is used for its URL-based routing, which is ideal for the web target and supports deep linking.
- **UI Design System**: A centralized `ThemeData` object in `MaterialApp` defines all colors, fonts, and styles. Reusable widgets (e.g., `PrimaryButton`) are created to ensure UI consistency.

# Development Process and Conventions

This document summarizes the AI agent-based development workflow, roles, and conventions for this project. It is synthesized from `ai-agent-workflow.md`, `gemini-integration.md`, and `tasks-conventions.md`.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Task-Centric**: All development work is managed within isolated task packages located at `tasks/<date>-<slug>/`.
- **Single Source of Truth**: `TASK.MD` within each package is the central hub for all instructions, logs, and decisions related to a task.
- **Knowledge Separation**:
    - **Static Knowledge**: Long-term knowledge like architecture, standards, and conventions are stored in the `context/` directory.
    - **Dynamic Context**: Task-specific, synthesized context is generated into `SYNTHESIZED_CONTEXT.MD` for one-time use.
- **AI Agent Collaboration**: The workflow relies on a team of specialized AI agents orchestrated by the developer.

## 2. AI Agent Roles

- **Developer**: Oversees the entire process, defines tasks, provides instructions, and gives final approval.
- **Gemini CLI (Orchestrator)**: Manages the task lifecycle and synthesizes context. Its primary role is to create `SYNTHESIZED_CONTEXT.MD` based on `TASK.MD` and the `context/` knowledge base.
- **Claude Code (Implementer)**: Executes development and refactoring tasks as instructed in `TASK.MD`.
- **Codex (Debugger)**: Analyzes errors and suggests solutions when Claude is blocked.

## 3. Development Workflow Lifecycle

The development process follows a four-step lifecycle managed by the `gemini` helper script.

### Step 1: Task Creation
- **Command**: `gemini task new "<descriptive-task-title>"`
- **Action**: Creates a new directory `tasks/<date>-<slug>/` and initializes it with a `TASK.MD` file from the template.

### Step 2: Context Synthesis
- **Command**: `gemini task run-context` (executed within the task directory)
- **Action**: Gemini CLI analyzes the `TASK.MD`, gathers relevant static knowledge from `context/` (guided by `.gemini/metadata.json`), and generates a tailored `SYNTHESIZED_CONTEXT.MD` file for the current task.

### Step 3: Development Cycle
1.  The **Developer** provides specific instructions to Claude Code in the "Í∞úÎ∞ú ÏßÄÏãú" (Development Instruction) section of `TASK.MD`.
2.  **Claude Code** executes the instructions, logging all activities, progress, and issues in the "ÏûëÏóÖ Î°úÍ∑∏" (Work Log).
3.  If errors occur, **Codex** is invoked to analyze the problem and provide a solution, which is also logged.

### Step 4: Task Completion & Knowledge Assetization
1.  Once the goal is achieved, the **Developer** fills out the "Î≥ÄÍ≤Ω ÏÇ¨Ìï≠ ÏöîÏïΩ" (Summary of Changes) and "Ïª®ÌÖçÏä§Ìä∏ ÏóÖÎç∞Ïù¥Ìä∏ ÏöîÏ≤≠" (Context Update Request) sections in `TASK.MD`.
2.  **Command**: `gemini task complete`
3.  **Action**: The task package is moved to `tasks/archive/`, and a record is appended to `context/CHANGELOG.md`. Any requested updates to the static knowledge base (`context/` files) are then performed based on the "Ïª®ÌÖçÏä§Ìä∏ ÏóÖÎç∞Ïù¥Ìä∏ ÏöîÏ≤≠".

## 4. Key Artifact: TASK.MD Structure

The `TASK.MD` file is the operational center of every task and contains the following sections:
- **ÏûëÏóÖ Î™©Ìëú (Task Goal)**: A clear, measurable objective.
- **Ïª®ÌÖçÏä§Ìä∏ ÏöîÏ≤≠ (Context Request)**: Specifies the required static and dynamic context.
- **Í∞úÎ∞ú ÏßÄÏãú (Development Instruction)**: Concrete instructions for Claude Code.
- **ÏûëÏóÖ Î°úÍ∑∏ (Work Log)**: A complete record of all actions, results, and errors.
- **Î≥ÄÍ≤Ω ÏÇ¨Ìï≠ ÏöîÏïΩ (Summary of Changes)**: A detailed summary of code modifications upon completion.
- **Ïª®ÌÖçÏä§Ìä∏ ÏóÖÎç∞Ïù¥Ìä∏ ÏöîÏ≤≠ (Context Update Request)**: Specifies what new knowledge should be integrated into the `context/` base.
- **ÏµúÏ¢Ö Í≤ÄÌÜ† (Final Review)**: Developer's final approval and feedback.

# Database Design (Entity Relationship Diagram)

This document outlines the database schema for the project, based on `docs/ÏÑ§Í≥Ñ Î¨∏ÏÑú/DB ÏÑ§Í≥Ñ/ÏóîÌã∞Ìã∞ ÏÑ§Í≥Ñ.md`.

## High-Level Summary

The schema is divided into three main domains:
1.  **Users & Permissions**: Manages users, roles, permissions, and group memberships.
2.  **Groups & Content**: Manages groups (workspaces), channels, posts, and comments.
3.  **Recruitment & System**: Manages recruitment posts, tags, and user notifications.
